# FVWM-Crystal: Fullscreen
# Written by: Dominique Michel 2008-2020
# <dominique_libre@users.sourceforge.net>
# replace the Fullscreen functions written when fvwm did not have native Fs support.
# but now (2019) fvwm have that support, so rewrite things around.
#
# How to use:
# Bind "Fullscreen" command somewhere, example:
#
# 	Key KP_Multiply		A $[Mod1] Fullscreen
#
# Disappear overview
# When using this function, Fvwm-Crystal will cycle through all the fullscreened
# windows and the workbench on the current page.
# To use it, bind "Disappear" command somewhere.
#
# 	Key KP_Multiply		A $[Mod2] Disappear
#
# The other window size functions are into Window-Buttons.

# Fullscreen functions {{{1
# "State 4" is used by Icon-Thumbnails.
# Browser Workaround: We need a wrapper for the "modern" browser windows, because we want fvwm-crystal
#     Fullscreen function to have a higher priority than the browwser F11 key or FS video mode.
#     We use "State 6" for that. We must insure 2 conditions:
#       1) When a browser window is put in FS by fvwm-crysstal, it must remain in that state or visualy fake this behavior.
#       2) It must be no screen flickering when the browser interfere with "Maximize Fullscreen". For that,
#          we need to manage the title bar and borders with State 6.
# Some other software begun to use the F11 fulscreen mode, so we generalize that workaround to all wwindows,
# which anyway is simpler to do and imply less maintenancee, than to test each individual software window.
