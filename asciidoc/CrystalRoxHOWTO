CrystalRoxHOWTO - Crystal ROX! HOWTO - (Read as "Crystal rocks!" ;)

SYNOPSIS
--------

None


DESCRIPTION
-----------

In this HOWTO I will show you how to setup FVWM-Crystal desktop with ROX-Filer
file manager, so they are working smoothly.


What is ROX-Filer?
------------------

(From the ROX-Filer manual)
ROX-Filer is a graphical file manger for the X Window System. Its user
interface is based on the RISC OS filer and it supports similar features such
as application directories and drag-and-drop loading and saving of files. The
filer can also act as a pinboard, allowing you to pin frequently used files
onto the desktop background.

In Crystal, while you can utilize an application-based work system (open an
application and from it's menu open a document), ROX-Filer will let you use
also document-based work style (open a document file in selected application),
of course after a little customization of Filer's settings.


How to make ROX-Filer work with FVWM-Crystal?
---------------------------------------------

Install ROX-Filer. I assume that executable is called *rox*. If name is
different, change it accordingly or make a symlink to */usr/local/bin/rox*.

In FVWM-Crystal you can select a *desktop manager* to use. This option is
located in: Diamond => Preferences => Desktop manager. Select ROX-Filer.
Crystal will ask you to logout and start again your X session - you can do it
right away or later, if you wish.

If everything was correctly installed, FVWM-Crystal should run with gray
background and *Home* icon in the upper-left corner of the screen (that's
ROX's pinboard). Now click on the background and from the menu select
*ROX-Filer* => *Options*. Go to *Iconified windows* and turn off *Show iconified
windows* option. Now go to *Compatibility* section and turn on *Pass all
backdrop mouse clicks to window manager* option. This way you will be able to
open terminal windows using RMB on the desktop. ROX-Filer menu can be still
accessed by clicling with RMB on the icons. You can now change ROX's options
at will.

You can change desktop wallpaper using the Crystal's menu system.


Known issues:
-------------
- window thumbnails aren't transparent, probably because FVWM doesn't use
  ROX's pinboard as the source of transparency for it's icons?
- Icon selected on the desktop stays selected; that's because ROX-Filer sends
  all mouse button clicks to the window manager. If you don't want a selected
  icon on the desktop all the time, open a directory or launch a file from
  your desktop.
