Note:
-----
If you want to modify some bindings, the best place is to put them into
  ~/.fvwm-crystal/userconfig

That file will be read at the very end of Fvwm-Crystal startup and restart.
That way, your changes will not be lost after an update, and they will be
read after all the other configuration settings.

In case you want to reassign an existing binding to another key, the best
practice is to unassign the old key and assign the new one. As example:

----
Key grave A $[Mod1] -
Key grave A $[Mod1]2 -
Key Q A $[Mod1] QuakeConsole
Key Q A $[Mod1]2 QuakeConsole
----

will unassign Fvwm-Crystal binding (Alt + `) that launch the QuakeConsole
and assign it to (Alt + Q).

To reassign another function to an existing binding, it is just to reassign
the binding. As example:

----
Key grave A $[Mod1] MyFunction
Key grave A $[Mod1]2 MyFunction
----

will reassign the QuakeConsole binding (Alt + `) to MyFunction.
The first binding is for use without NumLock, the second one is for use
with NumLock (The 2 after $[Mod1]).

For the signification of the modifiers, read the key and mouse commands
description into `man fvwm`, as well than the output of

----
less "${FVWM_SYSTEMDIR}"/components/functions/Keyboard-Modifiers
----

while FVWM-Crystal is running.
