FVWM-Crystal and session management
-----------------------------------

Gnome's Session management have evoveld a lot.
The bad news is than it is more complicated than before.
The good news is than it is much more easier to setup.

In order to use session manager in Gnome, you need to follow
the following steps:

1) Install Gnome, gnome-session and gconf-editor.

2) From the Crystal menu -> Nested sessions, start Gnome.
   The following steps are inside your nested Gnome session.

3) Start a console and run
    fvwm-crystal --replace &

   Don't exit this console. At that point, you must have a mix of Gnome and FVWM-Crystal.

4) Start gconf-editor from Gnome's menu (Applications-System Tools->Configuration Editor).
   Under desktop->gnome->session modify the key required_components_list
   and remove every thing but windowmanager.
   Modify desktop->gnome->session->required_components->windowmanager to,
   I am sure you know what, fvwm-crystal.
   Exit gconf-editor.

5) From Gnome's menu, start System->Preferences-> Startup Applications.
    Go into the second tab and save the current state of the running applications.

6) Exit Gnome and close the Xephyr window.
  You are back into FVWM-Crystal.

7) With a file manager, go into ~/.config/gnome-session/saved-session
  and look at the files. One must contain one line begining with something like
    Exec=fvwm -f /usr/bin/../share/fvwm-crystal
  Keep this file and remove all the other.

8) Restart the nested FVWM-Crystal session. That's all.
_______________________________________________________

You will find 2 more options into the Crystal Quit menu: Save session and Manage session.

For the change to be permanent, replace fvwm-crystal by gnome-session into
/usr/share/xsessions/fvwm-crystal.desktop (graphical login users)
or ~/.xinitrc (startx users).
________________________________________________________

Bug: For the correct wallpaper to appear, FVWM-Crystal must be resterted or a new
    wallpaper must be choosen.

Keybindings: Ctrl-Alt-Shift from inside the nested session will grab and release the mouse.
  This keybinding is Xephyr dependant and can change on your system.

Warning: Your Gnome session will be the same than a FVWM-Crystal session after making
    those changes. In order to restore a "normal" Gnome session, remove all the files in
    ~/.config/gnome-session/saved-session and the ~/.gconf directory. By doing this,
    you will loose session management suport inside FVWM-Crystal.

TODO: Make FVWM-Crystal session management work together with a "normal" Gnome session.
